# wp-get-the-table
A plugin that lets you grab an HTML table from a URL by ID, and echo it out onto a page via shortcode. Use your own stylesheets and responsiveness with on-page <table> elements rather than ugly iframe embeds of offsite data.

Plugin lives in trunk folder, or get it from the wordpress plugin repo
